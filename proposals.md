## Problem
For many types of applications, we need to support notification system, such as notify user for renew subscriptions, notifiy user when someone sent a message,
or even some promotional messages. We need to store it, send the notification via email, sms or web push notification. It seems there is no one open source
system/service to do this whole stuffs, so we want to build something which can do all this stuffs. Developer can integrate this service to their own ecosystem
and then no need to worry about this feature.
